### Visualizing COVID 

COVID impacted the entire world, and changed the way we went about operating in our daily lives. I was curious to see what impact COVID had on a world wide scale. Having a passion for healthcare, I wanted to make sense of some of the numbers. 

The goal of this project was to query a COVID dataset, and then create a dashboard to visualize the uncovered insights and data trends.
