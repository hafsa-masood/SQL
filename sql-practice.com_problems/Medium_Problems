-- Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending.

SELECT 
  DISTINCT(YEAR(birth_date))
FROM 
  patients
ORDER BY 
  YEAR(birth_date);
  
-- Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs once in the list.
   For example, if two or more people are named 'John' in the first_name column then don't include their name in the output list. 
   If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in the output.

SELECT 
  DISTINCT(first_name)
FROM 
  patients
GROUP BY 
  first_name
HAVING 
  COUNT(first_name) = 1

-- Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6 characters long.

SELECT 
  patient_id, first_name
FROM 
  patients
WHERE 
  first_name LIKE "S%s" 
  AND 
  LEN(first_name) >= 6;
